// Shopping Cart Discount: Create a Dart program that simulates a shopping cart. Ask the user to enter the prices of multiple items they want to purchase, and store them in a list. Calculate the total price of the items. Apply a discount of 10% if the total price exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $100). Use if-else statements to check for the discount eligibility and display the final price.
