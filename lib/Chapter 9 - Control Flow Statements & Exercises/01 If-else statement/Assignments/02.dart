// Leap Year Checker: 

// Create a Dart program that takes a year as input from the user and determines whether it is a leap year or not. Use if-else if statements to check the conditions for a leap year. Remember that a leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
