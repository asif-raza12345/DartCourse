// Word Frequency Counter: Create a Dart program that takes a sentence as input from the user and counts the frequency of each word in the sentence. Store the word-frequency pairs in a map. Display the word with the highest frequency. If multiple words have the same highest frequency, display all of them. Use if-else statements to compare frequencies and determine the highest frequency.
